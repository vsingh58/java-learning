1. CLI - Command-Line Interface
Using it, you can create tables, inspect schema and queray table, etc.

\n For text files, each line is a record, so the line feed character separates records.
^A (“control” A) Separates all fields (columns). Written using the octal code \001 when explicitly
specified in CREATE TABLE statements.
^B Separate the elements in an ARRAY or STRUCT , or the key-value pairs in a MAP .
Written using the octal code \002 when explicitly specified in CREATE TABLE
statements.
^C Separate the key from the corresponding value in MAP key-value pairs. Written using the octal code \003 when explicitly specified in CREATE TABLE statment.

Optimized Joins
We discussed optimizing join performance in “Join Optimizations” on page 100 and
“Map-side Joins” on page 105. We won’t reproduce the details here, but just remind
yourself that it’s important to know which table is the largest and put it last in the
JOIN clause, or use the /* streamtable(table_name) */ directive.

Hive does not support the optimization for right- and full-outer joins.
